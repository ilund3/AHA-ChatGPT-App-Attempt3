TIAs, which occur before about 15% of strokes, are considered 'warning strokes' — they are associated with additional TIAs, full-blown strokes or other cardiovascular problems later. Most of these later health problems happen within just days or weeks of the TIA, so early interventions to reduce risk are vital. Remember 'F.A.S.T.' to know when to call for help.

The condition is more common with increasing age, and in people who smoke or have a history of vascular disease (conditions that affect your blood vessels). Experts estimate that 10 silent strokes occur for every stroke with detectable symptoms. Despite being called 'silent,' these infarcts have been linked to subtle problems in a person's movement and mental processing. They also are linked to future risk for stroke and dementia.

HDL (high-density lipoprotein) is often called 'good' cholesterol because it helps remove LDL cholesterol from your arteries. Triglycerides are another type of fat in your blood. High triglyceride levels combined with high LDL or low HDL cholesterol can increase your risk of heart attack and stroke. Optimal levels: Total cholesterol less than 200 mg/dL; LDL less than 100 mg/dL (or less than 70 mg/dL for those at very high risk); HDL 60 mg/dL or higher; Triglycerides less than 150 mg/dL.

Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a temporary blockage that causes stroke-like symptoms but doesn't cause permanent damage. Ischemic strokes can be caused by thrombosis (clot forms in brain artery) or embolism (clot travels from elsewhere). Hemorrhagic strokes can be intracerebral (bleeding within brain) or subarachnoid (bleeding between brain and skull).

The AHA recommends no more than 2 drinks per day for men and no more than 1 drink per day for women. One drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits. Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure, increase risk of stroke and heart failure, contribute to obesity, and lead to other health problems. Some studies suggest moderate alcohol consumption may have heart benefits, but the AHA does not recommend drinking alcohol for heart health. The risks generally outweigh any potential benefits. People with certain conditions should avoid alcohol entirely, including those with heart failure, high blood pressure, or a history of stroke. The AHA emphasizes that there are better ways to improve heart health, such as eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and not smoking.",

Most Americans consume far more sodium than recommended - about 3,400 mg per day on average. Most sodium comes from processed and restaurant foods, not the salt shaker. High sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure, which increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. To reduce sodium intake: Read nutrition labels and choose lower-sodium options; Cook more meals at home using fresh ingredients; Use herbs and spices instead of salt for flavoring; Limit processed foods, canned foods, and restaurant meals; Rinse canned foods to remove some sodium. The AHA's Heart-Check mark can help identify foods that meet sodium criteria. Gradually reducing sodium allows taste buds to adjust to less salty foods.",
